            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ASI was caſting in my Mind to preſent you with ſomething in token of my high Eſteem for
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36769:6"/>your Virtue, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily met with theſe LAST HOURS of a young <hi>French</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; in which I found ſo many things rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, uſeful and edifying, divinely tranſporting and inflaming, that I concluded it a Gift moſt agreeable and comporting with your Pious and Devout Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:36769:6"/>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd in my thoughts to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> to you, as judging it (ſetting aſide my own Faults) moſt worthy of your Acceptance. For what can be imagined more ſtrange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, than to ſee ſo tender an Age, ſo weak a Sex, ſo
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:36769:7"/>delicate an Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly combating the moſt formidable of all things, that <hi>King of Terrours,</hi> but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over, and trampling on him?

Or what can be thought more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Virtue, than
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36769:8"/>to ſee not onely the peaceful, but joyful Latter End thereof; and what great Triumphs &amp; Exultations at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, even in the moſt difficult and affrighting Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Laſt Scene of Life? In a word, MADAM, you may ſee here the miraculous and powerful effects of the RELIGION
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:36769:8"/>you profeſs, and the GRACE you entertain and have choſen for your Portion and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, how eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing muſt turn to its advantage, and how all that oppoſe it, ſerve onely to adorn it with never-fading Trophies of Glory.

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is ſo rare a thing to ſee Perſons of Quality, in the flower of their Age, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſengag'd and ſet looſe from the World and Vanities thereof, and it is of ſo great import to publiſh ſuch Edifying Examples as theſe, that
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36769:11"/>we may ſuppoſe the best of all ſorts will think themſelves oblig'd by our communicating to them the <hi>Laſt Words</hi> of the Lady <hi>Margaret de la Muſſe,</hi> it being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to read them, without being powerfully affected therewith. For (indeed) we find in this little Piece ſo many Objects of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as we are at a ſtand where to fix it moſt. We have here a <hi>Lady</hi> preſented to us, who at
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:36769:11"/>the Age of Sixteen years, when others onely begin to enter upon the Stage of the World, and to reliſh the vain Pleaſures of it, earneſtly deſires to leave it; and not minding ought, ſave thoſe Felicities which never end, affronts Death, and all its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Concomitants, with ſo much Conſtancy, Bravery, and Foy, as if ſhe were full of Days, and had liv'd to that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:36769:12"/>moſt term of Life, which uſes to make Death wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; who, at thoſe years, when others have ſcarce attain'd ſome ſlight Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Impreſſions of <hi>Piety,</hi> and are only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the firſt Rudiments of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> ſpeaks ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly and worthily of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Grounds</hi> of her <hi>Hope,</hi> that one would think ſhe had ſpent an Age in the reading and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:36769:12"/>meditation of thoſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Records.</hi> To be brief, we ſee a <hi>young Virgin,</hi> who being dearly belov'd of all her Relations and Friends, might be thought to have ſtrong ties to the Earth, where ſhe was about to leave them, and yet ſpeaks of nothing but Heaven, &amp; the Salvation her <hi>SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR</hi> purchas'd for her; Who every moment darts her flaming deſires to the All-Glorious and Lovely
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36769:13"/>Cauſe of them; and who amidſt the extream Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; Pangs ſhe ſuffers, permits not the leaſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur against <hi>Divine Providence</hi> to 'ſcape her lips; but meekly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the will of her <hi>Creator,</hi> triumphs by Faith, over all the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Oppoſitions of <hi>Nature.</hi> Finally, we ſee a <hi>Mother,</hi> who though ſhe were moſt ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted to find her ſelf at the point of parting with
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:36769:13"/>Her ſhe moſt tenderly lov'd, yet has Courage enough to comfort her <hi>Daughter</hi> in her last Conflicts, and is not at all aſham'd to learn to die well of Her, whom ſhe had taught to live ſo. It's like there will not be found ſo exact a Connexion in all that this Illuſtrious <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirer</hi> delivers, as ſome critical ears may require; but beſides, that it is not ſtrange to find the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of <hi>Dying</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:36769:14"/>broken and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that it was not well poſſible to retain all ſhe ſpoke, I dare affirm, that the <hi>Reader</hi> will meet with ſo many ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and affecting Paſſages in theſe Papers, that he will give little heed to their connexion, or exactneſs of ſtile. In a word, the onely aim in publiſhing <hi>This,</hi> is to expoſe to view the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Effects of <hi>Grace,</hi> when it works on the
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:36769:14"/>Heart, and ſeizes it for its own; making the very Mouths of Children the Trumpets of its Praiſe. <hi>GOD,</hi> of his infinite Mercy, grant to us all, <hi>That we may die the Death of the Righteous, and that our latter End may be like theirs.</hi>

            <head>THE <hi>Laſt Words</hi> AND Edifying Death OF THE LADY <hi>Margaret de la Muſſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Lady <hi>Margaret de la Muſſe,</hi> whoſe <hi>Laſt Words</hi> are here recorded, was of one of the Nobleſt Families in the Province of <hi>Britany,</hi> ſhe being the Daughter of <hi>Caeſar, Lord Marqueſs de la Muſſe,</hi> and the Lady <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulina de Champagne de la Suſe,</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36769:16"/>who, together with their Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Anceſtors, have held ſo conſiderable a Rank in the Kingdom, that the onely naming of them may ſuffice to convince the World of it. But it is not for that alone, they deſerve the Eſteem of all men, as being far more eminent for their great Piety and exemplary Virtue, than Nobleneſs of Bloud. Their great and unparallel'd Zeal for God's Glory, and unmovable Conſtancy in the <hi>True Religion,</hi> cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be commended and admir'd; Afflictions and Sufferings, which are the Lot of the Church-Militant here on Earth, having never been able to make them renounce the Doctrine our Saviour taught, and his Martyrs have ſeal'd with their Bloud: For they all-along made it their chiefeſt Buſineſs, more and more, to eſtabliſh the Covenant of God, and knowledge of his Truth in their Family; and to the end all the Children God had given them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36769:16"/>might he Heirs of their Piety and Virtue, as well as Eſtate, their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt concern and care ever was to afford them, together with a good Education, the powerful Example of an Holy Life. And though God has ſome time ſince depriv'd this Illuſtrious Family of Him who was the Head of it, yet by the Care of his moſt pious Lady, Godlineſs has no leſs flouriſh'd in it, than before; inſomuch, that God being honour'd and fear'd, his Holy Name call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Sacred Word made the ſubject of conſtant Meditation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, this Wiſe Mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had the comfort and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee her Cares and Deſires herein, anſwer'd by every one of her Children; and particularly by this Daughter of hers, whoſe <hi>Dying Words,</hi> are here rehears'd, who in the laſt moments of her Life, did in a ſpecial manner, ſhew how deep an impreſſion thoſe good Inſtructions had made on her, which ſhe had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36769:17"/>receiv'd in her moſt tender Age.</p>
            <p>THIS Pious young Lady, after ſome days indiſpoſition, which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grew upon her, did on the 4th of <hi>May</hi> 1681. being Sunday, fall into ſuch violent Fits, that as ſoon as ſhe was come to her ſelf again, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her Latter End was near, deſir'd the Lady her Mother ſhould be call'd, that ſhe might receive her Bleſſing, and be comforted by her; who no ſooner appear'd, but this Dutiful Daughter, ſtretching forth her Hands to her, with all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion imaginable, ſpake thus: <hi>My dear Mother, now is the time God will call me to Himſelf. Let us put our ſelves in a condition of coming into his Preſence. But alas! how unworthy am I to preſent my ſelf before him! How weak is my Faith, and how diſproportionate my Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance! Pray entreat God for me, that he would grant me the Pardon of my Sins, and ſpeak Peace to my Soul. Oh, how unhappy am I, He does
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36769:17"/>not ſpeak at all to my Soul! O beg of Him to have mercy on me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW much ſoever the Lady her Mother found her ſelf mov'd at this Diſcourſe, yet ſhe had ſo much power over her ſelf, as to return her this Anſwer: <hi>Dear Child, it's true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.2.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> in God's ſight no man living <hi>(but through his mercy)</hi> can be juſtifi'd. <hi>But has not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World made an atonement for the greateſt Sinners? Have not the ſins of</hi> David, Manaſſes, <hi>St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the penitent Thief, and abundance of others, been forgiven them?</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>(as you very well know, my Child)</hi> did not come to call the Righteous,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> but Sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'TIS true</hi> (repli'd the young Lady;) <hi>but ſuch a repentance I do not find wrought in me, as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of thoſe he calls to him: for alas, he ſpeaks not to my Soul. My dear Child</hi> (anſwer'd the Lady her Mother) <hi>ſince your heart is ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36769:18"/>of grief for your Sins, it's a ſign that your Conſcience is not ſear'd or ſtupifi'd; there is ſomething that fights within you; And what can that be but the Holy Ghoſt? Always put your truſt in God's Mercy, and the Merits of your Redeemer, who has ſaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6 17.</note> Him that comes to me I will in no wiſe caſt out. At the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which comfortable words, the Patient, with her Eyes lifted up to Heaven, broke out into theſe: <hi>O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>draw me then, that I may run after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN ſhe deſir'd to ſee their Chaplain Monſieur <hi>de Malnoe;</hi> who no ſooner was acquainted with it, but he repair'd to her Chamber, in company of ſome Gentlewomen of the Neighbourhood he met at the door, to whom, as they drew near to her Bed-ſide to ſee her, ſhe ſpoke thus: <hi>My dear Friends, I beg of you, pray to God that he would be pleas'd to have mercy on me.</hi> And then turning to the Miniſter, ſhe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36769:18"/>earneſtly deſir'd him to aſſiſt her with his Prayers and comfortable Exhortations.</p>
            <p>AND ſome few hours after this, ſhe finding her ſelf uneaſie in her Chamber, deſir'd to be (and was accordingly) remov'd to another; and ſhe ſtill growing worſe and worſe, requeſted to be recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God in the Prayers of the Church. In the mean time ſhe would hear nothing but Godly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and always was talking of the heinouſneſs of her ſins. Whereupon being told, that it was very pleaſing to God to ſee us accuſe our ſelves before him; <hi>'Tis true</hi> (cry'd ſhe) <hi>Whoſoever does confeſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his ſins, ſhall have mercy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ALL the reſt of the day ſhe ſpent in lamenting and bewailing the weakneſs and imperfection of her Piety; and no ſooner was fallen into a ſlumber, but ſhe awak'd and call'd for the Chaplain; ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in Meditation and Prayer, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36769:19"/>frequently calling upon God, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thus:

            </p>
            <p>THE Lady her Mother ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in this happy condition, call'd thoſe in again, who were gone out of the Room, that they might be Witneſſes of this her Joy and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36769:26"/>Conſolation, as they had been of her Sorrows. She was at this time ſitting up in her Bed, with her hands joyned together, and her Eyes lifted towards Heaven; her looks being very lively and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and her countenance brisk, though modeſt. For the the ſpace of ſix hours ſhe ſpoke with a loud voice, and did expreſs much in few words; uſing terms very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to repreſent, ſometimes her Happineſs, and ſometimes the Joy ſhe was filled with; interlacing her diſcourſe with ſeveral Sentences both of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhe utter'd ſo faſt and fluently, that it was impoſſible to remember them all; and mixing her inſpir'd thoughts with thoſe written Dictates of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſometimes made her addreſs to our Lord for the Redemption he had vouchſafed to her; and then again humbled her ſelf before him. At another time ſhe congratulated her

            <p>BESIDES, She paraphraſed ſeveral Chapters of the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> as the 5th, 8th, and 12th of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the 17th of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel; applying them to her ſelf, much after this manner: <hi>My God,</hi> there is now no condemnation to them that are in CHRIST JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS: <hi>I have therefore nothing to fear, for I do with all my heart lay hold of his merits, who is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the World.</hi> I am made free from the Law of Sin and Death, <hi>which does no more at all affright me; and I feel the Spirit of Eternal Life communicated to me by my Saviour.

               <hi>Be kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned

May He, that good God, bleſs you with his choiceſt Bleſſings; may He alſo bleſs your Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and eſtabliſh his Covenant with them for all Generations, as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure.</q> Then ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to give her Bleſſing to the young Ladies her Siſters, (whom ſhe call'd to her) and likewiſe to her Brothers, Brothers-in-law, Siſter-in-law, and Niece, though they were abſent. And after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36769:34"/>this, deſiring they would all come near her, who were in her Chamber, and had (in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Chaplain) watch'd with her the night before, ſhe in a moſt tender manner em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd and bleſs'd them all; ſpeaking to every one of them according to their reſpective conditions, and that ſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and properly, that ſhe was the admiration of all.</p>
            <p>AND in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhe ſhew'd a great deal of reſpect to <hi>Monſieur de la Colom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brie,</hi> (who was Steward of the Houſe) expreſſing her acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to him for his great concern and affection for their Family, deſiring him to continue the ſame.

               <q>O how great is my love for you, my dear Friends; I love every

            </p>
            <p>NOW ſhe hearing ſome body weep about her Bed, ſaid, <q>Don't you mourn for me, but mourn for your ſins.</q> Then preſently recalling her words, ſhe thus expreſs'd her ſelf: <q>Oh, let us lament and bewail our ſins!</q> And for a proof ſhe was not mov'd at all with the tears they ſhed on her account, added,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16.</note> That <hi>now ſhe knew no body after the fleſh.</hi> Which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle ſhe had learn'd of Monſieur <hi>Royer,</hi> to whom a pious Lady ſpoke it on her Death-bed. Whereupon ſhe calling him to mind, wiſhed him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36769:36"/>all happineſs, and gave him the character of a real good man; ſaying, <q>He is a perſon whom I have always obſerv'd to be moſt piouſly and charitably inclined. I pray God bleſs him, and more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Gifts in him. Would I could ſee him, I know he would ſpeak comfortable words to me, and we would edifie one another.</q> Here ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated her earneſt wiſhes for a Bleſſing upon Monſieur <hi>de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe,</hi> whom ſhe always call'd her good Paſtor, and her dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and embracing him, hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray'd, that he might ever live quietly and in peace with his Brothers, and Proſperity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from his Family; ſaying to him, <q>I heartily beg of God to bleſs you and your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</q> And ſhe at the ſame time expreſſed alſo a great deſire to ſee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36769:36"/>Monſieur <hi>de Briſſac,</hi> praying God likewiſe to bleſs both him and his. Thus having ſpoken for a while to the Standers-by, ſhe began again to return her thanks to God, with the ſame zeal and fervency as before; ſaying, with <hi>David,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THUS ſhe took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the paraphraſing of the Scripture; ſeeming, as it were, to have receiv'd a new <hi>Vocation</hi> from God, and above all, <hi>that</hi> of teaching every one their duty: Neither was ſhe wanting in the ſtirring up of her ſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of her own, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rehears'd theſe words of the Pſalmiſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.1.</note>

            <p>IN the mean time they that ſtood by, looking on a Watch that was upon the Table, and perceiving thereby (it being now paſt Mid-night) that ſhe had been ſpeaking above ſix hours, were much aſtoniſhed, conſidering the vehement pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of her heart, and the difficulty ſhe had to fetch her breath: Which made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany deſire her to leave off diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, for fear of ſpending her ſelf too much. But this advice was ſo unwelcome to her, that ſhe preſently, with ſome indignation, anſwered, <q>I cannot hold my tongue, I muſt ſpeak;</q>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.1.</note> for, <hi>My heart is inditing of a good matter. O

               <hi>my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will ſing and give praiſe with the beſt member that I have.</hi> After which, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſilent for a little while, broke out immediately into theſe words: <q>O what pain do I ſuffer in holding my peace!</q> And indeed ſhe had no ſooner left off ſpeaking, but they heard a Ratling in her Throat that was very troubleſome to her; but ſhe nevertheleſs continu'd ſtill to entertain her ſelf with God; when the Company with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, the Lady her Mother laid down her ſelf by her, and both of them had a pretty good reſt that night.</p>
            <p>THE next morning (being Thurſday) after ſhe had had ſome diſcourſe with the Lady her Mother, ſhe gave her hand to a Gentleman of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, that was come to viſit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36769:39"/>her; and obſerving him to weep, ſaid to him, <q>What, Sir, do you weep? Is it becauſe God has a love for me, and will take me to himſelf?</q> Here ſhe alledg'd the Example of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> whom God took out of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved him, that he might not ſee thoſe calamities that were to befal the city of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the whole <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Nation. Then ſhe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lady her Mother, ſaid, <q>O dear Mother, how well compos'd am I at this time! I feel no pains at all; but am very eaſie, and do perceive my Saviour has deliver'd me from all my fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: Therefore I will give him eternal thanks and praiſe.</q> Whereupon ſhe preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to recite ſeveral Pſalms (both in Proſe and Verſe) as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36769:40"/>the VI. XXV. XXVII. XXXII. XXXIV. LXVI. CIII. CXVIII. CXLVI; inſiſting particularly upon thoſe places that were moſt proper for her condition, and afforded her moſt comfort: which ſhe uttered with ſo much zeal and devotion, that it made the Lady her Mother ſay to her, <q>Well, dear Child, thou art a going to make one in the Quire of Angels and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims, and ſhalt very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſing the Song of the Lamb. Yes, (anſwered ſhe) I ſhall make ſweet Melody, and ſing everlaſting <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> to his Glory.</q> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lady her Mother was very attentive to what ſhe ſaid, added, <q>Good Mother, we muſt always endeavour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie our Neighbours by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God; and adminiſter ſuch Comfort to them, as we would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36769:40"/>be glad to receive our ſelves at God's hand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AFTER this, a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man asking her, whether ſhe would not take ſomething, ſhe anſwered, <q>I have no will of my own; bring me what you will, and do what you pleaſe with me, it will be all one to me.</q> Then ſhe turn'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlewoman, that was juſt come into the Room, who expreſſing her ſelf to have been much edified by the good things ſhe had heard her ſpeak the night before, this devout Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient reply'd, <q>My dear Friend, don't you wonder at my ſpeaking ſo long with ſo much boldneſs and freedom, who was ever baſhful, and of few words? Theſe are Gifts of God not to be forgotten.</q> Which having ſaid, ſhe look'd about, and perceiving the Lady
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36769:41"/>her Mother weep, ſaid to her, <q>'Tis not you, dear Mother, have cauſe to ſhed tears; 'tis Madam —</q> (ſhe meant a Gentlewoman, who was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to one that was turn'd a <hi>Papist</hi>) <q>who has reaſon to bewail her Daughter. But as for yours, ſhe is going to Him who is the Diſpenſer of true Glory, and not of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SOME hours after this, the young Ladies her Siſters coming to ſit upon her Bed, the Lady their Mother came and ſate with them; and as ſhe was ſaying to God,<note place="margin">Iſai, 8.18.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, Lord, here am I, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thou haſt given me;</hi> the Patient anſwer'd, <q>Dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us yield thanks to God.</q>

               <q>Pray, my

How miſerable (alas!) ſhould I have been in the World, where we do nothing elſe but offend Him, go through a great deal of trouble (being our own Tormentors) and in a word, run after Vanities, and mind nothing but Pride.</q> To which the Lady her Mother anſwered, <q>My dear Child, thou waſt very far from being worldly minded, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vain or proud thoughts. O Mother (replied ſhe) you did not know the bottom of my heart: Certainly I had pride in me, and would fain have made a ſhew in the World; and (perhaps) if I

               <hi>(Lord, thou hast magnified thy word above all thy Name.)</hi> And withal ſhe charged them to learn the Pſalms of the late Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Conrart</hi>'s Tranſlation, and Monſieur <hi>Gilbert</hi>'s; picking out (firſt) ſuch as afforded moſt comfort. As for her, ſhe had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36769:42"/>got twenty five of the former, and twelve of the latter, by heart, at thirteen years of age; and the whole Book of Pſalms, according to the Old Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhe had learn'd at the late Lady Marchioneſs <hi>de Verac</hi>'s, that was both her Aunt and God-mother, with whom ſhe liv'd for a time. She had alſo ſeveral of them in Proſe by heart, which ſhe extreamly delighted in; and though ſhe was very perfect in ſundry Chapters, and moſt of the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying places of the Scripture, (which ſhe could ſay without Book) yet ſhe did oft complain of her want of memory.</p>
            <p>AFTER a little pauſe, ſhe began afreſh to ſpeak, and applying her ſelf to one of the young Ladies her Siſters, ſhe exhorted her above all, to learn a certain Prayer out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36769:43"/>Book, called <hi>[Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againſt the Terrours of Death]</hi> for God's Aſſiſtance and Grace to die well, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to uſe the ſame daily; intimating, that God had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her ſelf all the Petitions therein. She was alſo wont to repeat every morning the 90th Pſalm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord thou haſt been our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge from one generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and ſo on, to the end.</p>
            <p>A GENTLEWOMAN of the Neighbourhood having brought her two Daughters to her, whom ſhe had the night before deſir'd to ſee, ſhe ſaid to them, <q>My dear Friends, have always the fear of God before your Eyes, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that eternal truth which is in his Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Obey your Parents and Superiours;</q>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.15.</note> And <hi>love not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36769:43"/>the World, neither the things that are in the World; for if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT the ſame time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred four or five other She-Friends of hers, wiſhing them with her, and one above the reſt, whom ſhe ever had a great kindneſs for, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her to the Lady her Mother, deſiring her to take care of, and provide for her. And the Lady her Mother na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her ſome others, ſhe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray'd God to bleſs them all, and in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner implor'd his Divine help and aſſiſtance for one, who lay under an extraordinary great affliction.</p>
            <p>WHEN ſhe was in health, ſhe was not more backward, than ſhe was forward and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36769:44"/>to ſpeak now ſhe was ſick; delivering her ſelf with a great deal of freedom, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting nothing of what ſhe knew to be edifying. After which, ſhe fell into a little ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and reſted about an hour; and then awaking, one of her Phyſicians was ſurpriz'd to find her ſo well compos'd, ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaking, nor looking like one that was ſick, but on the contrary having a ſerene counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a free and undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed mind. He did alſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hear her talk ſo well, as ſhe did, of her condition; but yet for all that, he now began to deſpair of her Recovery, conſidering her great ſhortneſs of breath and weakneſs of her Stomach, that was not able to bear any thing: Nevertheleſs, ſhe took whatever he gave her, ſaying to him, <q>Sir, I will do
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36769:44"/>any thing you ſhall pleaſe to direct and preſcribe; for ſince you are called to look after me, and give me relief, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me to follow your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Lady her Mother, whoſe follow was greater than can be imagin'd, and who had no other comfort than what ſhe receiv'd from her obſerving the Holy and Bleſſed Frame ſhe was in, ſaid to her, <q>O dear Child, how edifying were thy Words to me laſt night, and are ſtill! Aye, ſurely (replied ſhe) my mind was then much at liberty, and I had a great deal more freedom in my utterance than ever before. I was ſpeaking very eloquently and freely of the wonderful works of God; and my mouth did utter things I never knew before. I then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36769:45"/>was made acquainted with the Myſteries of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are not to be known here below. I cannot expreſs them to you;</q> for they are <hi>Things unſpeakable;</hi> and through <q>Mercy, I continue ſtill in this heavenly condition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE reſt of the day ſhe was very ſtill, and felt almoſt no pains, except when they gave her ſomething; for that did ſet her a coughing. her ſlumbers were frequent; and as ſhe waked, always addreſs'd her ſelf to the Chaplain, and congratulating her happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, rejoyced and triumph'd in the Grace ſhe had receiv'd the day before.

            </p>
            <p>THEN ſhe enter'd upon a moſt excellent Edifying Dialogue (which is intended to be publiſh'd by it ſelf) with the Chaplain, who proteſts ſhe therein open'd his Underſtanding in a moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner; and after that, ſpoke to the Lady her Mother, thus: <q>Dear Mother, my Soul is poſſeſs'd with that <hi>Peace of God which paſſes all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

               <q>O Death! thou that bring'ſt good tidings, how welcome wouldſt thou be to me, by caſting me into the Arms of my deareſt Friend,</q> who <hi>has loved me before the foundation of the World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS day ſhe was viſited again by one of her She-Friends, who being come to her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, expreſs'd an extream ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to ſee her in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with that gave her her hand, which the Patient ſqueezing in hers, reply'd to her, <q>O my Dear, did you but know the Divine Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons my God has beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and how happy I am, you would confeſs with me, that I ſhould have been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, without this his gracious Viſitation.</q>

            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:36769:51"/>
            <p>THEN ſhe ſaid, <q>Pray let my Chaplain be call'd in, that he may comfort me. O the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt are the refreſhment of my Soul.</q> 
               <hi>LORD,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>DURING this whole day (which was Wedneſday) ſhe ſpake many other admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, that could not, all of them, be remember'd. One would have thought by ſeeing her, that her Soul was ſet looſe from the Body. She had quite forgot the Earth, and all Ties and Relations here; her onely thoughts being now to unite her ſelf with her God by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, till ſhe might be more perfectly united to him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>ABOUT Evening ſhe felt a great drought in her Throat, and was very thirſty; yet they durſt not give her any thing,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36769:52"/>by reaſon her Stomach could not bear ſo much as one drop of fair Water, without bringing of it up, and that with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Cough, accompani'd with a ſtoppage and ſhortneſs of breath; they therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd for an Epitheme, to allay her great palpitation of heart. But ſhe little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Relief they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give her Body, cry'd out on a ſudden, <q>LORD JESUS! thou my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſician, apply the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thy precious Bloud to me; for that alone can infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heal my Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IMMEDIATELY after this, ſhe fell into moſt cruel A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, which made her take very little reſt all that night: But yet ſhe continu'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her ſelf in God; ſeeking no-where elſe, but in his Word,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36769:53"/>for a Remedy to all her griefs. And in theſe circumſtances ſhe often cry'd,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.10.</note>

            </p>
            <p>WHICH having ſaid, ſhe asked a Gentleman that was opening the Windows of her Chamber, what time of the day it was; he anſwer'd, It was almoſt day-light; adding, <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, why do you ask me this Queſtion? have you a mind to do as <hi>David</hi> did, and riſe by break of day to praiſe God?

            <p>IN one of theſe Fits ſhe did cry to God, <q>Lord, have mercy on me.</q>

Every word of theſe Divine Hymns, was a Sacred Balm for her, which ſhe apply'd to her Wounds with ſuch ſucceſs, that ſhe preſently found her grief give way to the virtue of it. And what is more to be wondred at, is, that the violence of her pains had not almoſt alter'd her at all; but ſhe look'd as fair as ever. Her Eyes were brisk and lively; her Countenance gay, and her Speech ſtrong: yet did ſhe not think her ſelf to be in this condition, when obſerving them, who were about her, to look upon her with mournful Aſpects, ſhe ſaid to them, <q>I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36769:62"/>ſuppoſe I fright you. Pray, reach me a Glaſs, that I may ſee how I look.</q> Which being brought her, and ſhe having view'd her ſelf in it, ſaid, <q>God be thanked, yet I look very chearful:</q> And then in a kind of contempt ſtriking the Glaſs with her hand, bad them have it away.</p>
            <p>THE Lady her Mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring nothing more than an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to give this dear Daughter of hers ſome Token of her Tenderneſs, and let her ſee, that ſhe was very far from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting her, as ſhe ſuppos'd, did offer to kiſs her. But the Patient withdrawing her ſelf, and ſeeming to be as much ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at it, as if her Mother had been going to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ſaid to her, <q>Ah, Mother, what d'ye do? Sure you forget your ſelf.</q> And turning to the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36769:62"/>other ſide of the Bed, where the Chaplain ſtood, ſaid to him, <q>Is this not a cruel thing? I am got looſe from the World, and my Mother would tye me to it again!</q>
            </p>
            <p>A little while after this, ſhe alſo perceiv'd that her Siſter the Lady <hi>De Ponthue,</hi> with whom ſhe had ever liv'd in perfect love and union, look'd upon her with a very compaſſionate look; but without being in the leaſt mov'd or concern'd at it. And now finding none of thoſe kind and tender motions, which her great love to her Siſter had formerly inſpir'd her with, ſhe ſaid to her, <q>Pray, dear Siſter, forbear; you are no more to me now, than another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT ſeven a clock in the Evening, the doors of her Chamber being ſet open, ſhe ſaid to Monſieur <hi>de la Colombrie,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:36769:63"/>'Sir, that is the place (pointing with her hand to the Chappel, in which were the tombs of her Anceſtors) <q>where this my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is very ſuddenly to be laid up, till the Day of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Juſt.</q> Upon which, he taking occaſion of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, whether ſhe had any Commands to lay upon him; <q>No, Sir, (reply'd ſhe) my thoughts are no more emply'd about things here below, now my Soul is rais'd up to Heaven already; and if ſhe ſtill animates this Body, it is but to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual praiſe to my God.</q> And thus perſiſting to turn all her diſcourſe to the concerns of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhe went on, and ſaid, <q>I have overcome all the fears of ſin; I ſhall alſo conquer all my pains, though they be never ſo great:</q> Yea, <hi>I ſhall be more than Conqueror through JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S

               <q>O how worthy is this Combat of my Courage!</q>
            </p>
            <p>WITH theſe and the like Expreſſions, ſhe either took out of the Scripture, or receiv'd more immediately from the Holy Ghoſt, ſhe was entertaining her ſelf and the Company; and would frequently ſay, <q>I ſhall be ſhelter'd from the wrath of God;</q> and often repeated theſe Ejaculations: <q>O my God, I will ever love thee; I will ever bleſs thee! And thou, my Soul, be of good chear.</q> 
               <hi>Not my will, Lord, but thine, be done. Come, Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>; yea, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE were the words ſhe us'd in her Complaints, and with which ſhe appeas'd her grief. But for haſty and murmuring words, there fell not one from her mouth. And as ſome body was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36769:64"/>once ſpeaking to her of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the Devil, and his great Warrings againſt the Faithful, at all times, eſpecially when they were at the point of death, ſhe cry'd out, <q>Tuſh, I fear him not.</q>

            <p>AS it drew towards Mid-night, ſhe fell into a little ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and her Friends, that were continually with her, were glad of this opportunity they had to take a little repoſe alſo: for as they had watch'd, ſuffer'd, and pray'd, ſo they were willing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36769:64"/>likewiſe to take ſome reſt, with her. The Lady her Mother, who had laid her ſelf down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſide of her Bed, heard her about an hour before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, often repeat theſe words: '[Mercy, Lord, Mercy. <hi>Come LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, come quickly:</hi>] And ſhe obſerv'd, that her Daughter's cries did not expreſs any grief now, but a great deal of joy, which ſhe took notice of to others. It was now <hi>Friday</hi>-morning, when the Lady her Mother ſeeing her enjoy a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tranquillity, than ſhe had ſince the preceding <hi>Wedneſday</hi> at night, and that ſhe look'd very chearfully, ſaid to her, <q>Dear Child, the Lord will ſuddenly put an end to our troubles.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36769:65"/>countenance, looking upon my Lady, ſaid to her, <q>Dear Mother, I ſhall not die: Death is but a paſſage to a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant happy Life.</q>

            </p>
            <p>WHICH having ſaid, ſhe now ſpoke no more to any body; onely ſhe once cried out, <q>O how much ſorrow and joy, how much grief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort do meet together in me!</q> and then lay down, and fell into a ſlumber. In which ſhe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36769:65"/>had not long continu'd, but the Pangs of Death came upon her; ſhe had vehement riſings at her Stomach; her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was fallen; ſweat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from her Body in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; the Ratling in her Throat increaſed; and her Eyes grew dim and were diſtorted. And being in this condition, one of her Acquaintance, by name Madam <hi>Herault,</hi> touch'd her arm, thinking ſhe was a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: But ſhe recover'd of this Fit; and theſe Agonies being ſomewhat over, her Eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed the ſame briskneſs and livelineſs as before; ſhe rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them with both her hands, to diſperſe the Clouds that had begun already to cover them. Her Countenance alſo was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its former gaity and chearfulneſs; and ſhe was heard to make a Melody, in ſinging the 84th <hi>Pſalm.</hi>

But as he was going out of the room, her Body was re-animated on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and ſitting up again in her Bed, ſhe ſang the ſecond time.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Into thy hands, Lord, I commit</l>
               <l>My Spirit, which is thy due;</l>

            <p>THEN he drew near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and laying his Ear to her mouth, heard her ſay to God,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.29.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou ſhy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace, according to thy Word.</hi>

               <hi>For mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> Which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving utter'd, ſhe, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the leaſt, breath'd forth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36769:69"/>three Sighs, and ſo gave up the Ghoſt; there being ſeen at the ſame time, both in her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Eyes (which remain'd half open) a ſignal impreſſion of Joy, that ſhew'd her Soul had a taſte of the Celeſtial Bliſs, even before the Bonds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was ty'd to the Body, were wholly diſſolv'd.</p>

            <head>Here follows the PRAYER Taken out of Monſ. <hi>Drelincourt</hi>'s COMFORTS Againſt the <hi>Terrours of Death,</hi> Which is mention'd in the 55th Page of this Book.</head>
            <p>O <hi>GOD of all Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Father of our Spirits,</hi> I know that <hi>any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36769:70"/>Death of thy Beloved Ones, is precious in thy ſight;</hi> and that whatſoever mine may be, thou wilt take care of my <hi>Salvation. I weighing</hi> every thing in <hi>the Balance of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> do find it very little imports me, whether my Life be taken away by a Diſeaſe, or forc'd from me by Violence, provided my <hi>Soul</hi> enter into thy <hi>Glory,</hi> and be made <hi>Partaker</hi> of thoſe <hi>unutterable Felicities</hi> that are with thee. To me it muſt be all one, whether my <hi>Lamp</hi> go out of it ſelf, or be blown out by any contrary wind;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36769:70"/>ſo it be but kindled again at the <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſhine in the higheſt Heavens for evermore. Whatſoever Death I die, I ſhall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, provided I <hi>die in the Lord,</hi> and enter into that <hi>Eternal Reſt from all my Labours.</hi> O Lord, thou knoweſt all thy works from everlaſting. Thou, with one glance, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the deepeſt Abyſs, and ſeeſt to the very bottom of Eternity. As thou haſt preciſely appointed the <hi>Hour of Death,</hi> ſo haſt thou been pleas'd alſo to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the manner of it. O
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36769:71"/>Great and Living God! it is my Duty wholly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in thy Adorable Providence, and abſolutely ſubmit my ſelf to thy wiſe Decrees. But, O my God, my Heavenly Father! if thou wilt vouchſafe me <hi>(who am but duſt and aſhes)</hi> the liberty of ſpeaking to thee, and permit thy Child to pour [his / her] heart's deſire into thy <hi>Fatherly Boſom,</hi> I do, with all the powers of my Soul, humbly beſeech thee to grant me this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that I may <hi>know my End,</hi> and not be (like <hi>Job</hi>'s Children) ſurpriz'd by a ſudden Death: But, O
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36769:71"/>Lord, be thou pleas'd to give me notice of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as thou didſt to thy Servant <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> I do not ſue for years, but ſome few days; or at leaſt, a few hours Warning. I beg of thee, that my Mind may never be diſturb'd by any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Vapours, or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any falſe Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations or <hi>Deluſions</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> but that I may end my Days with all qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and tranquillity: that I may always have the free uſe of my Senſes, my Reaſon, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and above all, the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36769:72"/>Light of thy Grace, that ſo, I may glorifie thy Holy Name, and edifie my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to my very laſt breath. Finally, that my Soul may not be ſnatch'd away by any ſort of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but that I may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend it into thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Hands. <hi>Amen.</hi>
